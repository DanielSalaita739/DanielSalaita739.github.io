# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a variety of coding projects that I have worked on, covering topics such as:

- **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** â€“ A Pygame-based interactive visualization of sorting techniques.

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A Python-based sorting algorithm visualization tool using Pygame. It includes implementations of:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Linear Search

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files  

All project-related files are now inside the `Algorithms Project` folder for better organization.  

### **ðŸ“œ Main Scripts**  
- [`main.py`](https://github.com/DanielSalaita739/DanielSalaita739.github.io/blob/main/Algorithms%20Project/main.py) â€“ The main script running the visualizer.  
- [`professor_algos.py`](https://github.com/DanielSalaita739/DanielSalaita739.github.io/blob/main/Algorithms%20Project/professor_algos.py) â€“ Sorting algorithm implementations.  

### **ðŸ“º Demo Video**  
- [`SortingAlgorithms.mp4`](https://github.com/DanielSalaita739/DanielSalaita739.github.io/blob/main/Algorithms%20Project/SortingAlgorithms.mp4) â€“ A demonstration of the project in action. 

## More Projects Coming Soon!
Stay tuned for more projects as I continue learning and building.
