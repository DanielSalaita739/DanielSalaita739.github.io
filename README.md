# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a variety of coding projects that I have worked on, covering topics such as:

- **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** â€“ A Pygame-based interactive visualization of sorting techniques.

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A Python-based sorting algorithm visualization tool using Pygame. It includes implementations of:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Linear Search
